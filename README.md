The three images and jellyfish images off the internet,
and the two .mp3 files may play as the iframes switch in 
and out. They do on my phone ok. and my chromebook.

If you put all the files in a folder/directory of
and chromebook and or windows computer
then open/click on the .html file,
it should work ok after you have
clicked the start button.
